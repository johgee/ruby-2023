# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).
# first_name = "grace"
# last_name = "hopper"
# p first_name + " " + last_name

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# first_name = "grace"
# last_name = "hopper"
# p "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".
# puts "enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   p "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).
# color1 = "red"
# color2 = "green"
# color3 = "blue"
# p color1 + " " + color2 + " " + color3

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# color1 = "red"
# color2 = "green"
# color3 = "blue"
# p "#{color1} #{color2} #{color3}"

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."
# puts "enter a name: "
# name = gets.chomp
# if name == "Santa"
#   p "you're not santa"
# end

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
# book_title = "oop in ruby"
# book_author = "sandi"
# p book_title + " is by " + book_author

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# book_title = "oop in ruby"
# book_author = "sandi"
# p "#{book_title} is by #{book_author}"

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"
# puts "enter a password: "
# password = gets.chomp
# if password == "Joshua"
#   p "Shall we play a game?"
# else
#   p "Access denied"
# end

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
# city1 = "chicago"
# city2 = "new york"
# city3 = "seoul"
# p city1 + ", " + city2 + ", and " + city3 + "."
